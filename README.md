#Authentic
**Authentic** is [Webmin/](https://github.com/webmin/webmin)[Usermin/](https://github.com/webmin/usermin)[Virtualmin/](https://www.virtualmin.com/)[Cloudmin](http://webmin.com/cloudmin.html) theme based on [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) that is made with _love_. It uses [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) to highlight config files and show line numbers, when editing manually, [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/) to compose comprehensive HTML based messages and [DataTables](http://www.datatables.net/) to add advanced interaction controls to modules' tables. Theme runs using latest releases of dependent software (mentioned above), supporting all in-built modules (even ancient ones) and third-party modules, including [ConfigServer Security & Firewall](http://configserver.com/cp/csf.html).

##FAQ
###How do I install _Authentic_ theme?

####Webmin

  To install _Autentic_ theme from repository, just `clone` it into your wherever Webmin binaries folder _(libexec)_ is or [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qooob/authentic-theme/master/.build/authentic-theme-latest.wbt.gz) it directly and install it going from Webmin:

  `Webmin->Webmin Configuration->Webmin Themes->Install themes->From uploaded file`

####Usermin
  **a)** I'd recommend to create a _symlink_ to already installed _Authentic_ theme, which will enable you to only update Webmin installation of the theme not both.

  Creating a _symlink_ as easy as it gets by running as root the following:

  `ln -s /usr/libexec/webmin/authentic-theme /usr/libexec/usermin/authentic-theme`

> The above implies that Webmin binaries on your system are installed under `/usr/libexec/webmin/` and Usermin installation is in `/usr/libexec/usermin/`. The above is true for _CentOS_ and other RHEL distros at least. You could easily though find out where your installations are by running `/usr/bin/whereis webmin` or `/usr/bin/whereis usermin`.

  **b)** Nevertheless, you could simply install Usermin theme using the same procedure as for Webmin. To install a copy for Usermin go to:

    `Webmin->Usermin Configuration->Usermin Themes->Install themes->From uploaded file`

####Virtualmin/Cloudmin
There is no need to take any additional actions. In case _Virtualmin_ or _Cloudmin_ modules are installed, it will be automatically detected and supported.

####How do I set custom logos?
> Custom logos can be easily set for both authenticated users and for login screen. It can be done by coping a file named `logo.png/logo_welcome.png` to _Authentic_ Theme *configuration* folder. It's located to wherever _Webmin/Usermin_ sets it's configuration directory. For example, on most systems this path would resolve to `/etc/webmin/authentic-theme` for _Webmin_ and `/etc/usermin/authentic-theme` for _Usermin_. Make sure that the file containing logo is called `logo.png` for authenticated users and `logo_welcome.png` for login screen. You can access logos with custom CSS styles (read below) by its class name, which is correspondingly `_logo/_logo_welcome`. Recommended size is _180x90_ pixels. In case you want to remove the logo, just delete this file from configuration directory. In case you want to have _Authentic_ Theme logo, you can find it in theme installation folder (usually located at `/usr/libexec/webmin/authentic-theme`), under images directory, with the file name called `__logo.png`. Don't forget to rename it, to make it work, when uploading to *configuration* directory.

####How do I load custom styles?
> Custom styles are set by the same procedure described for the logos above. Only the file name that has to be copied to `/etc/webmin/authentic-theme` must be `styles.css`. For example, if you want to change `font-family` for the theme, you would have to add the following to custom `styles.css`:

```CSS
body,
html,
.tooltip,
.popover {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

####How do I load custom scripts?
> It's done the same way as described for styles and logos above. The file name that has to be copied to `/etc/webmin/authentic-theme` must be `scripts.js`. For example, if you want to load custom script and output something to browser's console, you would have to add the following to `scripts.js`:

```JavaScript
console.log('Custom script loaded...');
```

> Be advised, you might be surprised to see that your script is executed twice. It's because we technically have two `documents`, first is `main` container and second is `right` side that is loaded in _iframe_. You must refer to the exact `document` to make your script executed right.


####How do I use theme settings?
> Theme can be tweaked using inbuilt _settings_. The list of the _settings_ will be growing, depending on users' requests. At the moment, _Authentic Theme_ supports the following list of settings:


```JavaScript
// Display loader for the left frame
settings_loader_left = true;

// Display loader for the right frame
settings_loader_right = true;

// Replace dots in mailbox delimiter to slashes (UI only)
settings_mailbox_slash_delimiter = true;

// Show/Hide Webmin `Refresh Modules` link in the left menu
settings_menu_hide_webmin_refresh_modules_link = false;

// Show/Hide Webmin `Unused Modules` link in the left menu
settings_menu_hide_webmin_unused_modules_link = false;

// Make all accordions expanded on System Information page
settings_sysinfo_expand_all_accordions = false;

```

Settings must be initialized by the same procedure described for the scripts above. The only difference is that the file name, that has to be copied to `/etc/webmin/authentic-theme` must be `settings.js`. Afterwards, put directives from the list of settings above and control it using boolean data type `(true/false)`.


###Troubleshoot
> 1. `Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/libexec/webmin..) BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ..`: <br>
It happens because the theme is trying to load _Perl_ module dependency, that are not installed on your system. `LWP::Simple` - is the simplest and most common type of HTTP request. You can install it using CPAN module in Webmin itself or using CLI and package manager. For example, in RHEL distro you would be able to install it by running<br> `yum install perl-libwww-perl`. **Attention**: You must also install either `LWP::Protocol::https` or `Bundle::LWP` using CPAN or by package name `perl-LWP-Protocol-https` or `perl-libwww-perl`.
> 2. `Can't locate Net/SSLeay.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ..)`<br>
This happens because Webmin is trying to open a link and download the theme using _https_ protocol. `Net::SSLeay` - is high level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS). You can install it using CPAN module in Webmin or using CLI. Package name is `perl-Net-SSLeay`.
> 3. `Can't locate object method "parse" via package "version" (perhaps you forgot to load "version"?) at`. Installing `version` from CPAN, using CPAN module in Webmin will fix this error.
